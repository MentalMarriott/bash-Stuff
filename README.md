Bash-Stuff
==========

A few bash programs that I make when I get bored 

* AliasCdScript - Takes a directory as a parameter then creates a CD alias to each sub directory. e.g. If the Desktop directory was provided and the desktop contained 3 folders named a, b and c then after the script has been ran and you have logged back in you can change to the folders locations by simply typing in the name of the folder.
